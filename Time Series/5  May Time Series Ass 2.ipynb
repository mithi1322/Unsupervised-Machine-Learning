    "These are patterns or variations in a time series that occur at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, in time-dependent seasonal components, the seasonal behavior can change or evolve over time. For instance, seasonal patterns might exhibit variations that are not constant from year to year.\n"
